This module is based on a third-party library called [FBOW](https://github.com/rmsalinas/fbow). FBOW is licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

FBOW (Fast Bag of Words) is an extremmely optimized version of the DBow2/DBow3, which are open source C++ libraries for indexing and converting images into a bag-of-word representation. The library is highly optimized to speed up the Bag of Words creation using AVX,SSE and MMX instructions. It is used for keyframe retrieval.
